# Multiple_linear_regression_project
This project implements multiple linear regression using Python, focusing on preprocessing data (removing unnecessary columns), training a linear regression model, and evaluating its performance with metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
